# CSS Grid and Flexbox Lab

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a complex web design using HTML and CSS with Grid and/or Flexbox
- Be able to apply aesthetic CSS rules to a web page

In this lab you will create and style a page for the shown travel website.

<img src="images/cctravel.png" width="250" >

The page will have
- Header with navigation
- Grid of favourite/top places
- Search Form 
- A grid showing popular countries to visit
- A grid showing popular places to visit in certain countries.
- Testimonials from users
- Footer showing some company details.

Each section has a dedicated CSS file so that you can separate out the concerns and style the appropriate area. Any CSS that affects the whole page should go in to `style.css`.

We have also provided you with a start point with HTML structure and some basic CSS. There are also images available for you to use. 

### MVP

Code the areas for:
* Favourite Destinations
* Popular Destinations
* Popular Places

### Extensions

Code the areas for:
* Search Form
* Testimonials

### Advanced Extension

Use media queries to make the page responsive for mobile. Create a new `responsive.css` file to work in.

## Getting Started

It is highly recommended that you start by breaking the design down into boxes. You can then start to decide which order to style each box in the HTML and consider how its contents should be structured.

The links shown do not have to do anything and the page does not have to look exactly like our examples. 

Your idea must have similar structure to the above example though and display good use of Css Grid and/or Flexbox.

Feel free to discuss ideas with a member of your instructor team.
